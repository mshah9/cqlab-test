Henry completed a Bachelor of Advanced Science at the University of New South Wales, majoring in Molecular and Cell Biology, and Microbiology. Henry joined the Crossley lab in 2017 whilst undertaking a research internship and continued with us for his Honours year in 2018 and his PhD from 2019 to 2022. For his PhD project, Henry explored how DNA methylation interacted with the Nucleosome Remodelling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex to control the expression of fetal haemoglobin. Following submission of his PhD thesis, Henry has joined as a postdoctoral research fellow, continuing his work to understand how DNA methylation and related facotrs coordinate the represson of fetal haemoglobin. Outside the lab, Henry loves getting out on his bike and challenging himself in all sorts of activities.
