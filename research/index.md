  title="Exploiting adipose tissue eosinophils to combat obesity"
  text="Obesity is a global health challenge with limited therapeutic options. Our aim is to discover novel molecular pathways controlling energy expenditure in adipose tissue to identify therapeutic targets that safely and effectively reverse obesity. Beige adipose tissue activity is associated with improved glucose and lipid homeostasis and reduced adiposity in both mice and humans, thus holding therapeutic promise to combat obesity. Eosinophils, cells of the innate immune system and are important for the beiging of white adipose tissue. Our team studies the way in which eosinophils drive beige fat activation by producing novel signalling 'eosinokines' which we aim to harness to reverse obesity. "

  title="Discovery of eosinophil-derived thermogenic beiging factors to combat obesity"
  text="As part of our research on a lean genetic mouse model with enhanced beiging, we generated the world-first transcriptome profiling in adipose-resident eosinophils. We discovered that adipose-resident eosinophils express genes encoding three key secreted proteins known to be critical for beiging.  We also identified other novel eosinophil-secreted proteins, which we term ‘eosinokines’, that we hypothesise have a role in beiging. We propose that eosinophils drive the beiging of subcutaneous white adipose tissue and that understanding their molecular messages will be important in therapeutically altering adipose metabolism in humans. The Quinlan team explores how stimuli known to increase (exercise and cold exposure) and decrease (obesity and ageing) beige fat activity influence the transcriptome and secretome of adipose resident eosinophils. In this project, we aim to identify and test the efficacy in vitro and in vivo of novel mouse and human eosinokines to promote beiging in subcutaneous white adipose tissue and combat obesity, paving the way for new anti-obesity therapies."

  title="Transcription factors that drive gene expression signatures in eosinophils"
  text="Eosinophils are immune cells that circulate in the blood and play a key role in allergic reactions, such as asthma where they exacerbate inflammation and tissue damage in the airway.  They are also known to have detrimental effects in inflammatory bowel diseases where they infiltrate the intestine. In the Quinlan lab we study the eosinophils in adipose tissue. However, eosinophils are not only harmful. Eosinophils migrate into and reside within tissues in the normal healthy state, termed homeostatic eosinophils, and are beneficial and necessary for physiological tissue functions. For instance, eosinophils that reside within white adipose tissue have been shown to regulate adipose tissue energy expenditure. These tissue resident eosinophils in the normal healthy state are far less well understood, partly due to their low abundance making them challenging to study. We first became fascinated by eosinophils through studying a mouse with a genetic disruption of the transcriptional repressor Krüppel like Factor 3 (KLF3). This KLF3 knockout mouse is lean and is protected from diet-induced obesity. We are currently exploring activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) as an important regulator of gene expression in adipose tissue eosinophils. The Quinlan lab also studies key transcription factor networks that delineate different tissue-resident eosinophil populations and explores heterogeneity within tissue eosinophil populations. The Quinlan lab aims to improve the understanding of the gene expression signatures of homeostatic tissue-resident eosinophils, and the transcription factors that establish these signatures. This may in turn allow refined eosinophil-ablating therapeutics in the future that specifically destroy inflammatory eosinophils without affecting beneficial homeostatic eosinophils."
