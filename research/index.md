  title="Exploiting adipose tissue eosinophils to combat obesity"
  text="Obesity is a global health challenge with limited therapeutic options. Our aim is to discover novel molecular pathways controlling energy expenditure in adipose tissue to identify therapeutic targets that safely and effectively reverse obesity. Beige adipose tissue activity is associated with improved glucose and lipid homeostasis and reduced adiposity in both mice and humans, thus holding therapeutic promise to combat obesity. Eosinophils, cells of the innate immune system and are important for the beiging of white adipose tissue. Out team studies the way in which eosinophils drive beige fat activation by producing novel signalling 'eosinokines' which we aim to harness to reverse obesity. "
